# WinSnap
### Snap and move windows with keyboard shortcuts

I have a super ultrawide monitor and snapping windows to half the screen isn't enough.

Inspired by [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) for mac, this little gadet lets you snap windows into halfs, thirds, quaters and sixths.

Works on windows and linux.

### Prerequisites
 
windows: [auto hot key](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

linux: python
