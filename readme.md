#WinSnap
##Snap and move windows with keyboard shortcuts


I have a super ultrawide monitor and snapping windows to half the screen isn't enough.

Inspired by [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) for mac, this little gadet lets you snap windows into halfs, thirds, quaters and sixths.

For winows an linux.

Prerequisites
 
 windows: [auto hot key](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

 linux: python
