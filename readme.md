# WinSnap
### Snap and move windows with keyboard shortcuts

I have a super ultrawide monitor and snapping windows to half the screen isn't enough.
Inspired by [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) for mac, this little gadet lets you snap windows into halfs, thirds, quaters and sixths.
Works on windows and linux.

### Prerequisites
 
windows: [auto hot key](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

linux: python

### Controls

**Win+Alt+Left:** Snap a window to the left. Repeated presses decrease the size of the window. 
**Win+Alt+Right:** Snap a window to the right. Repeated presses decrease the size of the window.
**Win+Alt+Up:** Center the window.
**Win+Alt+Down:** Increase window size by smallest allowed increment (1/6 of the screen width).
**Ctrl+Win+Alt+Left:** Move a window left by smallest increment.
**Ctrl+Win+Alt+Right:** Move a window right by smallest increment.

Linux Specifics

**Win+Alt+D:** Show/Hide the window decoration such as titlebar and borders. 
**Win+Alt+F:** Some windows on linux (usually default apps like settings and the file browser) have a huge invisible border, this might fix that - also might not idk what causes it.
